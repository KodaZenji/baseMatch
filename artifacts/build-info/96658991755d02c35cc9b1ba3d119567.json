Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\n * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\n * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\n *\n * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\n * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \"step\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\n * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\n *\n * For example:\n *\n * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n * ```solidity\n * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\n *     function initialize() initializer public {\n *         __ERC20_init(\"MyToken\", \"MTK\");\n *     }\n * }\n *\n * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\n *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\n *         __ERC20Permit_init(\"MyToken\");\n *     }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\n * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\n *\n * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\n * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\n *\n * [CAUTION]\n * ====\n * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\n *\n * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker.

@dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed\n behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\n external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\n function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\n The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\n reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \"step\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\n case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\n For example:\n [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n ```solidity\n contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\n     function initialize() initializer public {\n         __ERC20_init(\"MyToken\", \"MTK\");\n     }\n }\n contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\n     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\n         __ERC20Permit_init(\"MyToken\");\n     }\n }\n ```\n TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\n possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\n CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\n that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\n [CAUTION]\n ====\n Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\n An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\n contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke\n the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:\n [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n ```\n /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor\n constructor() {\n     _disableInitializers();\n }\n ```\n

Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect. The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \\\"step\\\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized. For example: [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding] ```solidity contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {     function initialize() initializer public {         __ERC20_init(\\\"MyToken\\\", \\\"MTK\\\");     } } contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {         __ERC20Permit_init(\\\"MyToken\\\");     } } ``` TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}. CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity. [CAUTION] ==== Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized. An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:

Emits a {Transfer} event.\"}},\"title\":\"ERC-721 Non-Fungible Token Standard, optional metadata extension\",\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/IERC721Metadata.sol\":\"IERC721Metadata\"},\"evmVersion\":\"shanghai\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":1000},\"remappings\":[]},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/IERC721.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xf78f05f3b8c9f75570e85300d7b4600d7f6f6a198449273f31d44c1641adb46f\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://e28b872613b45e0e801d4995aa4380be2531147bfe2d85c1d6275f1de514fba3\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmeeFcfShHYaS3BdgVj78nxR28ZaVUwbvr66ud8bT6kzw9\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/IERC721Metadata.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xf46268c37522320bb2119a5a394bc5c739a95c0c574c8d08e8c643f4d06e5c76\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://517e4b295f35b9947c72ad7379a6089439ece7bb6f4a2ea0a159da13046c039e\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmZXzkSfLUbvujig3zVbpDHykpHhqLpvQtdiN3B5j4TA3u\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/introspection/IERC165.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x8891738ffe910f0cf2da09566928589bf5d63f4524dd734fd9cedbac3274dd5c\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://971f954442df5c2ef5b5ebf1eb245d7105d9fbacc7386ee5c796df1d45b21617\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmadRjHbkicwqwwh61raUEapaVEtaLMcYbQZWs9gUkgj3u\"]}},\"version\":1}","storageLayout":{"storage":[],"types":null}}},"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/utils/ERC721Utils.sol":{"ERC721Utils":{"abi":[],"evm":{"bytecode":{"functionDebugData":{},"generatedSources":[],"linkReferences":{},"object":"60556032600b8282823980515f1a607314602657634e487b7160e01b5f525f60045260245ffd5b305f52607381538281f3fe730000000000000000000000000000000000000000301460806040525f80fdfea2646970667358221220084638590a1ecdf2fa69ceab435cb9d3d4b7de39d6fbd3a06c7c0e4d29ce0b7664736f6c63430008160033","opcodes":"PUSH1 0x55 PUSH1 0x32 PUSH1 0xB DUP3 DUP3 DUP3 CODECOPY DUP1 MLOAD PUSH0 BYTE PUSH1 0x73 EQ PUSH1 0x26 JUMPI PUSH4 0x4E487B71 PUSH1 0xE0 SHL PUSH0 MSTORE PUSH0 PUSH1 0x4 MSTORE PUSH1 0x24 PUSH0 REVERT JUMPDEST ADDRESS PUSH0 MSTORE PUSH1 0x73 DUP2 MSTORE8 DUP3 DUP2 RETURN INVALID PUSH20 0x0 ADDRESS EQ PUSH1 0x80 PUSH1 0x40 MSTORE PUSH0 DUP1 REVERT INVALID LOG2 PUSH5 0x6970667358 0x22 SLT KECCAK256 ADDMOD CHAINID CODESIZE MSIZE EXP 0x1E 0xCD CALLCODE STATICCALL PUSH10 0xCEAB435CB9D3D4B7DE39 0xD6 0xFB 0xD3 LOG0 PUSH13 0x7C0E4D29CE0B7664736F6C6343 STOP ADDMOD AND STOP CALLER ","sourceMap":"431:1490:14:-:0;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;-1:-1:-1;;;431:1490:14;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"},"deployedBytecode":{"functionDebugData":{},"generatedSources":[],"immutableReferences":{},"linkReferences":{},"object":"730000000000000000000000000000000000000000301460806040525f80fdfea2646970667358221220084638590a1ecdf2fa69ceab435cb9d3d4b7de39d6fbd3a06c7c0e4d29ce0b7664736f6c63430008160033","opcodes":"PUSH20 0x0 ADDRESS EQ PUSH1 0x80 PUSH1 0x40 MSTORE PUSH0 DUP1 REVERT INVALID LOG2 PUSH5 0x6970667358 0x22 SLT KECCAK256 ADDMOD CHAINID CODESIZE MSIZE EXP 0x1E 0xCD CALLCODE STATICCALL PUSH10 0xCEAB435CB9D3D4B7DE39 0xD6 0xFB 0xD3 LOG0 PUSH13 0x7C0E4D29CE0B7664736F6C6343 STOP ADDMOD AND STOP CALLER ","sourceMap":"431:1490:14:-:0;;;;;;;;"},"methodIdentifiers":{}},"metadata":"{\"compiler\":{\"version\":\"0.8.22+commit.4fc1097e\"},\"language\":\"Solidity\",\"output\":{\"abi\":[],\"devdoc\":{\"details\":\"Library that provide common ERC-721 utility functions.
