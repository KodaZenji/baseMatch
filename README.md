BaseMatch - what is this? 

BaseMatch is a dating mini app designed to reduce ghosting through real accountability.

You sign up with email and connect a crypto wallet.
When two people agree on a date, both stake a small amount.

✅ Both show up → funds are refunded

❌ Someone ghosts → they lose their stake

Built on Base for fast, low-cost transactions.
No real money is used during testing.
