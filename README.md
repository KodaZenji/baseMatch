BaseMatch – What is this?

BaseMatch is a dating mini-app designed to reduce ghosting through accountability and commitment.

You sign up with your email and connect a crypto wallet.
When two people agree on a date, both stake a small amount to show intent and seriousness.


---

Staking & Rating

Staking signals commitment.
Dates that stake are more likely to show up, and serious participants are rewarded.

Ratings are only available for staked dates and help build a more accountable community.

Outcomes

Scenario	s

 Both confirmed
 > Each gets stake back minus 5% platform fee	

(Neutral + sweet: fair and predictable)

One confirmed, other ghosted	
> Attendee gets 150% of stake minus platform fee, ghost gets 0	

(Sweet + bitter: attendee rewarded, ghost loses stake) 

Both missed confirmation	
> Both refunded 90% of stake; 5% platform fee + 5% missed-confirmation fee
	
(Neutral: small sting to encourage confirmation, no major punishment)


> Tooltip :
“Staking shows commitment.

Show up → stake returned + bonus reward (150% minus platform fee)

Ghost → stake forfeited

Missed confirmation → 90% refund, small fee deducted


Ratings are only available for staked dates and highlight serious participants.”
